# test-jekyll-github-actions

## About

Example set up using [jekyll-action](https://github.com/helaili/jekyll-action), a GitHub action that allows uploading a Jekyll website that uses other plugins not supported by GitHub Pages.

There are 2 branches:
- **main**: the Jekyll site code and the file .github/workflows/jekyll.yml, which contains the actions (actions/checkout@v2 is required)
- **gh-pages**: the production site

## Note
This is just an example for future reference. The Jekyll Action was created by [Alain Hélaïli](https://github.com/helaili/jekyll-action).
